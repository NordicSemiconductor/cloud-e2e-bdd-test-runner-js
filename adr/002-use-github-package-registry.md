# Use GitHub package registry

I have decided to use
[GitHub's package registry](https://github.com/features/packages) because NPM
back in 2019 could not be trusted to ensure the longevity of it's offering for
open-source project. In July 2019 Business Insider
[reported](https://www.businessinsider.com/npm-ceo-bryan-bogensberger-funding-2019-6)
that funding was only secured until early 2020. There was also a lot of tumult
at that time, most notably
[Laurie Voss leaving the company](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/18/npm_uninstall_cofounder_global/).
