# Move to Nordic Semiconductor GitHub organization

The [initial fork](./why-fork.md) was made to a personal GitHub account
(`coderbyheart`), this however does not reflect the ownership of the project.
Therefore the project is moved to the official Nordic Semiconductor GitHub
organization (`NordicSemiconductor`) from the `bifravst` GitHub organization in
February 2021. This move was cause by the
[_Bifravst_](https://github.com/bifravst/) project being promoted to an official
Nordic Semiconductor open-source project alongside with the release of the
[_Cat Tracker Firmware_](https://github.com/bifravst/firmware) in
[nRF Connect SDK](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf).
